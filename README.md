# network-packet-sniffer
Network packet sniffer using python (identifies the protocols, TCP and UDP), also retrieves source and destination ports,  and sequence numbers.

I developed a network packet sniffer using Python that captures and analyzes TCP and UDP packets transmitted over the network. This tool operates at a low level, directly interfacing with network interfaces to monitor real-time traffic. The sniffer dissects packet headers, extracting crucial information such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol types.

The project demonstrates my understanding of network protocols and data transmission, providing valuable insights into how data flows through a network. By implementing this sniffer, I gained hands-on experience with socket programming and packet analysis, enhancing my skills in cybersecurity and network management.

This tool serves as an educational resource for anyone interested in learning about network traffic, offering a practical application of network theory. I also included clear documentation in the README file to guide users on how to set up and run the sniffer effectively.
